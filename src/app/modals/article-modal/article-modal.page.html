      Cooking a perfect steak involves precise technique and a touch of personal
      flair. Here's a guide to help you master this culinary delight, with
      measurements in Celsius and kilograms.
    </p>
    <h2>Choosing the right steak</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cut: Popular cuts include Ribeye, Sirloin, T-Bone, and Filet Mignon.
          Ribeye offers a great balance of flavor and tenderness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grade: Look for USDA grades like Prime, Choice, or Select. Prime is
          the highest quality with the most marbling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thickness: A steak should be at least 1 inch thick, ideally 1.5 to 2
          inches for optimal cooking.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Preparing the steak</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Thawing: If frozen, thaw your steak in the refrigerator for up to 48
          hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Room Temperature: Bring the steak to room temperature about 30 minutes
          before cooking to ensure even cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seasoning: Keep it simple with salt and pepper or get creative with
          garlic powder, paprika, or your favorite steak rub. Apply generously.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Cooking methods</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pan Searing: Ideal for a crispy, caramelized crust. Use a cast-iron
          skillet for the best results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grilling: Perfect for adding a smoky flavor. Make sure the grill is
          hot before placing the steak on it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oven Roasting: Best for thicker cuts. Start with a sear on the
          stovetop, then finish in the oven
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Pan Searing</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat the Pan: Preheat your skillet over high heat and add oil with a
          high smoke point, like canola or grapeseed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cooking: Place the steak in the pan. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on
          each side for medium-rare, adjusting the time based on thickness and
          desired doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basting: Halfway through, add butter, garlic, and herbs (like rosemary
          or thyme) to the pan. Spoon the melted butter over the steak
          repeatedly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resting: Once cooked to your liking, let the steak rest for about 10
          minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Grilling</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preheat the Grill: Target a high temperature, around 230°C to 260°C.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grill the Steak: Cook for about 4-6 minutes per side for medium-rare,
          depending on thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Resting: Allow the steak to rest as with pan searing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Finishing touches</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sauces and Butters: Try compound butter, steak sauce, or chimichurri.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wine Pairing: A robust red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon or Malbec
          pairs well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sides: Consider roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>Uneven Cooking: Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness.</li>
        <li>
          Too Much Smoke: Ensure good ventilation and adjust the heat if needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
